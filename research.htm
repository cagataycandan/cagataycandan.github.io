          <p><strong>Sampling Rate Conversion: (Interpolation/Decimation, Fractional 
            Delay) </strong> </p>
          <p>In general, communication systems operate at different bit-rates. 
            The sampled input signal has to be converted from one rate to another 
            one, if the initial sampling rate does not match the expected data 
            rate of the communication system. </p>
          <p>The task is: Changing the sampling rate by fractional rates, the 
            classical interpolation/decimation problem but with non-integer rates.          </p>
          <p>The conversion can be achieved with exact accuracy theoreticaly. 
            The problem is finding efficient techniques approximating the exact 
            solution. </p>

          <p><strong>Efficient Structures for Resolution Increase in Fourier Domain:</strong></p>
          <p>DTFT takes discrete samples and produces a continuous spectrum representing 
            the response of the system (whose impulse response is given sequence 
            of samples) to a complex exponential. In DTFT the frequency of the 
            complex exponential is a continuous variable in [0,2pi). DFT is the 
            sampled version of the DTFT. That is, DFT output is simply the samples 
            of the DTFT taken uniformly with the spacing 2pi/N in [0,2pi). At 
            some applications, we may want to examine the spectrum in more detail. 
            To do that, theclassical technique is taking more point DFTs, that 
            is instead of N point DFT; we may take 10N point DFT and this results 
            in a DFT output with 2pi/(10N) spacing, resulting in 10 fold increase 
            in resolution. In some applications, we are only interested in a segment 
            of spectrum say segment of interest is [pi/3, pi/2]. Application of 
            10N point DFT increases resolution in the whole range of [0,2pi). 
            In this project, we want to study efficient methods resolution increase 
            in a segment. </p>

           Fractional Fourier transform can be used as a tool for chirp tracking. 
           Chirp tracking is known to be a difficult task due to its non-stationary nature. 
           Fractional Fourier filterbanks can be used to follow time varying chirp signals. </p>
